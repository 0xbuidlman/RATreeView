#Purpose 
RATreeView is a class designed to support implementation of the Tree View on IOS. It works as a wrapper for the UITableView, defining its own delegate and data source method for easier managment for tree data structures.

#ARC Compatibility
RATreeView is implemented using ARC.

#Installation 
To use RATreeView in your app, just drag RATreeView class files into your project. You can also setup RATreeView in your project using Pods. 


#Introduction
As RATreeView is a wrapper for UITableView most of delegate and data dource methods are just equivalents of specific methods from UITableView delegate and data source protocols. More about naming conventions in RATreeViewDelegate section. 


#RATreeNodeInfo
Almost every methods of the RATreeViewDelegate's and RATreeViewDataSource's protocol have the argument of the class RATreeNodeInfo. The purpose of this parameter is to support the user of the RATreeView which as much information as possible. RATreeNodeInfo is logically connected with *item* which is always provided when there is parameter of the class RATreeNodeInfo in the method. 

To make this possible RATreeNodeinfo has the following properties:
  
    @property (nonatomic, getter = isExpanded, readonly) BOOL expanded;

Returns YES if the item's row is expanded.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger treeDepthLevel;
Returns level of the item in tree. The value for to root item children is 0.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger numberOfParentChildren;
Returns the number of the children of the item's parent.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger positionInParentChildren;
Returns the position of the item in the item's parent children.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger numberOfChildren;
Returns the item's number of the children.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger numberOfVisibleDescendants
Returns the item's number of visible descendants. By visible descendant we mean items whoose parents are expanded.

#RATreeView
RATreeView has almost all properties which can be founf in UITableView.
#####It also implemements some new properties:
     @property (nonatomic) RATreeViewRowAnimation rowExpandingAnimation;
Animation used for expanding rows.


     @property (nonatomic) RATreeViewRowAnimation rowCollapsingAnimation;
Animation used for collapsing rows.


#RATreeView Data Source
#####RATreeViewDataSource contains following **required** methods:


    (NSInteger)treeView:(RATreeView*)treeView numberOfChildrenOfItem:(id)item
    
This method should return the number of the child items encompassed by a given item. If *item* is nil, this method should return the number of children for the top-level item.

    (UITableViewCell *)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView cellForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo
    
This method ask the data source for a cell to insert for a particular *item*.

    (id)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView child:(NSInteger)index ofItem:(id)item
    
This returns the child item at the specified index of a given item. If *item* is nil, returns the appropriate child item of the root object.

RATreeViewDataSource contains following **optional** methods:

    - (void)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle forRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo
    
This method ask the data source to commit the insertion or deletion of a specified row. For more info look into UITableViewDataSource apple's documentation.
    
    
    - (BOOL)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView canEditRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;
    
This method ask the data source to verify that the given row is editable. If not implemented are rows are assumed to be editable.  

#RATreeView Delegate
All methods of RATreeViewDelegate are **optional**. **RATreeViewDelegate contains almost all methods which all available in UITableViewDelegate**. For easier managment of the tree view names and arguments of this methods are slightly changed.

For example: 
    
    - (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath                                    // UITableViewDelegate
    - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView willBeginEditingRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath								        // UITableViewDelegate


is changed to:

     - (CGFloat)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView heightForRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;               // RATreeViewDelegate
     - (void)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView willBeginEditingRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;  //RATreeViewDelegate

     
     
#####RATreeViewDelegate contains following new (comparing to UITableViewDelegate) methods:

    - (BOOL)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView shouldExpandRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo

This method ask the delegate whether row for the provided *item* should be expanded due to the user interaction (selection by the user). Called for collapsed rows with at least one child. By default row would be expanded. 


    - (BOOL)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView shouldCollapaseRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;

This methods ask the delegate whether row for the provided *item* should be collapsed due to the user interaction (selection by the user). Called for expanded rows with at least one child. By default row would be collapsed.

    - (BOOL)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView shouldItemBeExpandedAfterDataReload:(id)item treeDepthLevel:(NSInteger)treeDepthLevel

This method ask the delegate whether the specific row should be expanded after data reload. It is called for every element after each reload of the data of the RATreeView. In case delegate return *YES* for the item whoose parent (or parents) aren't expanded, all unexpanded parent will be expanded.


#####Some methods with a little changed logic compared to the UITableViewDelegate:

     - (id)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView willSelectRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;

Tells the delegate that a specified row is about to be selected. Return item another that one passed as an argument to select another row. The item this method returns must be visible (that means it's parent must be expanded).

     - (id)treeView:(RATreeView *)treeView willDeselectRowForItem:(id)item treeNodeInfo:(RATreeNodeInfo *)treeNodeInfo;
     
Tells the delegate that a specified row is about to be deselected. Return item another that one passed as an argument to deselect another row. The item this method returns must be visible (that means it's parent must be expanded).
     
#Enums!
For the better encapsulation RATreeView declares some own enums which are equivalents for the enums declared for UITableView and UITableViewCell. These enums are used as properties types and in RATreeView's method calls. 

Equivalent for the UITableViewStyle:

    typedef enum {
      RATreeViewStylePlain = 0,
      RATreeViewStyleGrouped
    } RATreeViewStyle;

Equivalent for the UITableViewCellSeparatorStyle:

    typedef enum RATreeViewCellSeparatorStyle {
      RATreeViewCellSeparatorStyleNone = 0,
      RATreeViewCellSeparatorStyleSingleLine,
      RATreeViewCellSeparatorStyleSingleLineEtched
    } RATreeViewCellSeparatorStyle;


Equivalent for the UITableViewScrollPosition:

    typedef enum RATreeViewScrollPosition {
      RATreeViewScrollPositionNone = 0,
      RATreeViewScrollPositionTop,
      RATreeViewScrollPositionMiddle,
      RATreeViewScrollPositionBottom
    } RATreeViewScrollPosition;

Equivalent for the UITableViewRowAnimation:

    typedef enum RATreeViewRowAnimation {
      RATreeViewRowAnimationNone = 0,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationRight,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationLeft,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationTop,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationBottom,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationMiddle,
      RATreeViewRowAnimationAutomatic
    } RATreeViewRowAnimation;
